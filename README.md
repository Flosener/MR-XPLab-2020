# Mental rotation experiment

This repository contains a minimal example of a mental rotation experiment, built with \_magpie.

## Background

A leading theory in how visual recognition of differently orientated 3D objects is processed in the human brain, is that we use 'mental rotation' of the objects. In that we kind of mentally align them with each other to check for "sameness" or "difference". This would mean that different rotation angles would influence our decision making.

## Hypotheses (cf. Ganis & Kievit 2015)

1. Response times increase with the angular disparity between the two objects.
2. Error rates increase with the angular disparity between the two objects.
3. Different trial types have longer reaction times than same trial types.
4. Different trial types have higher error rate than same trial types.
